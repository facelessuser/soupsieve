# Soup Sieve

## Overview

Soup Sieve is a CSS4 selector library designed to be used with
[Beautiful Soup 4](ttps://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#). It aims to provide selecting, matching, and
filtering with using modern CSS selectors.

While Beautiful Soup comes with a builtin CSS selection API, it is not without issues. In addition, it also lacks
support for some more modern CSS features.

Soup Sieve supports a subset of CSS4 selectors which allows for filtering of tags in a Beautiful Soup object. Soup
Sieve does not attempt to support all CSS4 selectors as many don't make sense in a non-browser environment. Some of the
supported selectors are:

- `.classes`
- `#ids`
- `[attributes=value]`
- `parent child`
- `parent > child`
- `sibling ~ sibling`
- `sibling + sibling`
- `:not(element.class, element2.class)`
- `:is(element.class, element2.class)`
- `parent:has(> child)`
- and many more
